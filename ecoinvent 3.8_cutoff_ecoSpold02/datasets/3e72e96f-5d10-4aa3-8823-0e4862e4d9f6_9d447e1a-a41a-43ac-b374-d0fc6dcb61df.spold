          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Petroleum oil refineries are highly integrated multi-output production plants where nearly each process step creates a few co-products.

This data source has been complemented by various specific confidential refinery datasets, by values from Eurostat (e.g. in the case of the energy source mix or process energy), and by literature data. In the case of the BREF, a range of values were mentioned as process parameters for which the arithmetic averages were applied. After adapting the model to the up-to-date mass and energy flows within the European refineries, it has been validated and calibrated by comparing the results to the dataset of the BREF, the Eurostat and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR).</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This dataset describes the operation of a representative average petroleum oil refinery in the given geography.

          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">The ifeu petroleum refinery life cycle inventory (LCI) tool is based on the outputs of a complex refinery model that reproduces the complexity of petroleum refinery plants in which the combination and sequence of processes are usually very specific to the characteristics of the raw materials (i.e. the close relation between the composition of the crude oil and the products to be produced). Refineries differ not only in their configurations, process integration, feedstocks, product mixes, unit sizes, designs, and control systems but also the market situations, locations and ages of the refinery or environmental regulations can result in a wide variety of refinery concepts. It represents the current European state-of-the-art. The basic setting of the model reflects the technical characteristics of European refineries as described in the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document (BREF)for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas (European Commission, 2015). Further specific data was collected from companies and production plants and was incorporated in order to elaborate a comprehensive and robust model of a refinery.</text>

The production volume was calculated based on the total refinery intake in 2016 and the proportionate product output modelled in the ifeu tool. According to the applied model, on average 38.5 kg liquefied petroleum gas are produced per tonne of crude oil intake in European refineries. The total refinery intake in 2016 was 6.11E+11kg of crude oil (BP, 2017).
Mind that this calculated value may differ from the actual production volume reported in statistics.
