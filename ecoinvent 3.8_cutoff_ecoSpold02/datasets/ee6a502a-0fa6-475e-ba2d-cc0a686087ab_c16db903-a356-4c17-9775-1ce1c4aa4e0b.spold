        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">The primary use for elemental bromine is in the manufacture of bromine compounds that have chemical and biological activity, high density, or fire retarding and extinguishing properties. Bromine products are well represented in such use areas as gasoline additives, flame retardants, agricultural chemicals, drilling fluids, photographic chemicals, sanitizers, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and others.
The largest use of bromine is as ethylene dibromide (EDB), a lead scavenger additive used in gasoline with tetraalkyllead compounds to reduce engine knocking. In the past decades, the EDB share of the United States bromine market dropped from 70 % to under 30 %, which can be attributed partly to government regulations issued in 1973, gradually reducing the lead content in gasoline. The use of EDB as a fumigant in agriculture is also on the decline for environmental reasons.
The high-density characteristics of bromine compounds are advantageously applied in hydraulic fluids, gage fluids, ore flotation, and drilling fluids. Calcium bromide, 53 % in aqueous solution, was introduced in 1972 as a dense fluid product (1.70 kg/L) for use as oil well packs and completion fluids. The use of calcium bromide, zinc bromide, and sodium bromide as completion fluids in oil and gas well drilling grew rapidly in the 1970s, capturing 22 % of the elemental bromine market.
Another of the fastest growing uses for bromine is in the manufacture of flame retardants. Bromine fire retardants are benefiting from increased use of engineering plastics and hold an estimated 16 % of the elemental bromine market. Some of the major bromine products used as flame retardants are tetrabromobisphenol A, decabromodiphenyl oxide, and vinyl bromide.
Bromine is also used, either directly or indirectly, in sanitary preparations, water disinfection, in the desizing of cotton, in bleaching of pulp and paper, air conditioning absorption fluids, and hair waving compositions.

          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">Bromine (Br2; CAS 7726-95-6), a nonmetallic element of the halogen family, is a dark red-brown liquid at ordinary temperatures and pressures. It vaporizes readily and has a sharp, penetrating odour.  Bromine production utilizes bromine-containing liquors (brines), which occur naturally, or result from the manufacture of potassium salts or from seawater.
In most brines, as well as in ocean water, the molar concentration of chloride ions is likely to be 200 to 700 times as large as that of bromide ions. Therefore, isolating bromine from these sources requires a separation method of high selectivity. Fortunately, such a method exists. It is based on the greater ease with which bromide can be oxidized compared to chloride, and the fact that the oxidation product, bromine, is quite volatile. Chlorine serves as the most economical and convenient oxidant. 

Two general processes using chlorination for bromine recovery are based on this chemistry:
1. Steaming-out process for brines and waste liquors containing bromine
2. Blowing-out process for seawater.

Steaming-Out Process
Production of bromine from brines containing Br– in concentrations of 1 – 5 g/L basically follows the process described by Kubierschky in 1906.

Raw brine is warmed in a heat exchanger and caused to pass successively through two packed towers by gravity flow In the upper (smaller) tower, it meets a recycle stream of gases from which chlorine and bromine are absorbed. Near the bottom of the lower tower, chlorine and steam are introduced; as they pass upward, the chlorine reacts with bromide in the brine, and a mixture of bromine vapor and chlorine (about 85:15 by weight) with steam is taken off the top. The water and most of the halogens are condensed, the liquid phases enters a gravity separator and the gas goes to the upper tower. From the separator, water containing dissolved halogens is sent to the lower (steaming-out) tower and the heavier bromine layer, containing some chlorine, flows to a fractionating column. The chlorine vapors join the stream to the upper tower while the liquid bromine, about 99 % pure, is drawn off either for direct use in the manufacture of bromine compounds or to be further purified for sale or for more exacting uses.

The hot debrominated brine is treated to neutralize acidity and to reduce free halogens, if neces-sary, and then is passed through the heat exchanger, where it warms the incoming brine. 
More recent modifications of the original Kubierschky process are related generally to the larger scale of modern operations, to the materials of construction, which must be corrosion resistant, and to the procedures and instrumentation needed for control. Whereas originally most of the construction was stoneware, brick, or lead, now much of the material exposed to wet halogens is glass, tile, or other special ceramics or alloys; tantalum may be used for condensers. The processes are controlled by measuring pH, oxidation – reduction potentials, flow rates, temperatures, and pressures at critical points.

Some acidity is generated when chlorine reacts with reducing substances, such as hydrogen sulfide, in the brine. This acidity adds to the efficiency of bromine liberation by preventing hydrolysis to hypobromous acid. Use of sulfuric acid is not advisable if the brine contains calcium or strontium because they may precipitate as sulfates and foul the tower packing, heat-exchange surfaces, or brine disposal wells. However, sulfates will form if the brine contains sulfides.
 
Seawater Process
The first economically successful recovery of bromine directly from the sea was carried out near Wilmington, North Carolina (USA), using an air-blowing process originally developed for brine operations by H. H. Dow. The use of air rather than steam is necessary because the cost of steam to heat ocean water, with its bromine content of only about 65 mg/L, would be prohibitive. The Wilmington plant has since been abandoned, but the process is 1986 still employed, e.g., at Amlwich (Wales) and Hayle (Cornwall).
Water from the ocean is pumped to the top of blowing-out towers, with sulfuric acid and chlorine being added just above the pumps so that mixing takes place during the ascent. About 1.3 kg of 10 % sulfuric acid per ton of water is required to neutralize the natural hydrogen carbonates and bring the pH to 3.5; 15 % excess chlorine over the theoretical requirement is used.

Air is drawn up through the towers, sweeping out a mixture of bromine and chlorine (or bromine chloride) from the descending ocean water. The air is drawn next through absorber towers in which it is scrubbed counter-currently by sodium carbonate solution. 
To remove spray from the air, small packed chambers are interposed between the absorber towers and the fans. When the alkalinity of the scrubber solution is nearly depleted, the solution is brought first to a storage tank and then to a reactor in which it is treated with sulfuric acid and steamed to release bromine. The bromine is condensed and used in the manufacture of ethylene dibromide.
In a modification of the process, which was used for a number of years at Freeport, Texas, halogens blown from the ocean water are reduced with sulfur dioxide and absorbed in a water spray.
The resulting aqueous solution of mixed acids is treated with chlorine in a conventional steam-out tower and the bromine is recovered. The mixture of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid remaining is used for acidifying the raw ocean water.
The SO2 process has been described; further details of its operation at Freeport and the automatic controls employed there are available. Normal flow of incoming gulf water is 568 m3/min; the rubber-lined riser pipe is about 12 m tall and 2.1 m in diameter. A glass electrode at the top of the riser measures the pH to within 0.02 unit and controls “butterfly” valves in a return line on the acid supply pumps. Oxidation potential is controlled at about 970 mV with a platinum electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode, regulating the addition of chlorine. Oxidation potential measurements are also used to control the mixing of sulfur dioxide with the free halogen vapor stream and the chlorination of the reduced acid mixture.
Analytical methods used for bromide in brines and ocean water have been described. Usually the van der Meulen method or one of its various modifications is employed. Economic factors important in the location of seawater bromine plants, especially as they were related to the siting of the Amlwich operation, have been discussed; temperature of the water has a significant effect on the efficiency of the blowing-out process.
Because of the large volume of ocean water processed, the bromine-depleted stream must be discharged at some distance from the intake and in a favorable location from the standpoint of prevailing currents, to avoid dilution. Aside from this, waste disposal is not a problem since both the acidity and the free halogen content of the outgoing water are very low. In contrast, the waste stream from a strong brine process requires neutralization and, in some instances, reduction. In most cases, spent well brine is returned to the ground via disposal wells to maintain hydrostatic pressure within the formation. Acidity or free halogens should be absent to minimize corrosion of the system. Lime or caustic soda are customarily used for neutralizing acidity. The use of semiburnt dolomite with sodium thiosulfate has been recommended.
 
Electrolysis
Electrolysis was used in early production in Germany instead of chlorine to oxidize bromides. Two processes were developed in Germany. The Wunsche electrochemical process was based on the use of diaphragms to provide good current efficiency. The carbon cathodes were separated from the carbon anodes by porous clay cylinders, which allowed ion diffusion. The anode reaction product was bromine. The cathode reaction produced hydrogen and magnesium hydroxide, which created a major problem of clogging the clay diaphragm pores.
The Kossuth electrochemical process used bi-polar carbon plate electrodes with one side serving as anode and the other side as cathode. The power supply was connected to the end electrodes, and to dislodge the magnesium hydroxide deposits that built up on the cathodes, the current was periodically reversed for a short time. Despite this advantage over the Wunsche process, the Kossuth process had very low-current efficiency. The amount of power required related to bromine was 3000 kW h/t as compared to about 2000 kW h required to produce 500 – 600 kg of liquefied chlorine used to make 1 t of bromine by the Kubierschky process, which was being developed at the same time.
Another process for the recovery of bromine from seawater was developed on a commercial scale by Ethyl Corp. in the United States. The process involved the treatment of seawater with chlorine and aniline, and collection of the precipitated tribromoaniline. The company later used a 4200-t ship as a floating factory, which was unsuccessful.
Current bromine production methods are based on modified Kubierschky or steaming-out processes and Dow Chemical's blowing-out process.
 
Bromine from Recycle and Waste Brines
In the United States, a modified Kubierschky process has been used for recovering bromine as a byproduct from potassium chloride production liquors at Searles Lake. The Searles Lake brine contains ca. 0.085 % bromine, but it is too alkaline and too heavily buffered for direct use in the conventional chlorine process of liberating bromine. However, since potassium bromide and potassium chloride are isomorphous, the bromide crystallizes with the potassium chloride. This mixture, containing up to 1.8 % bromide, is neutral and therefore useable. When chlorinating this mixture, the bromine is expelled and recovered while an equivalent amount of new potassium chloride replaces the bromide and thus effects the desired purification of the chloride product.
For economic reasons, increasing attention is being given to the development of methods for recovering bromine from byproduct bromides, such as those obtained in halogen displacement reactions. Many substitution reactions produce a kilogram of bromine in the form of byproduct hydrogen bromide for each kilogram of bromine substituted in the desired product. The hydrogen bromide, which is usually released as a gas, is absorbed in water or in an alkaline solution using a scrubber. The aqueous scrubber effluent is acidified and chlorinated in order to recover the bromine for recycle. In some cases, the hydrogen bromide is recovered and used as is or as the bromide salt in other applications.
 
Purification
Bromine produced by either the steaming or blowing processes ordinarily contains as impurities chlorine, water, halogenated hydrocarbons, and acids (HCl or HBr). Fractional distillation brings the purity to 99.5 – 99.7 %, long associated with commercial bromine. Improvement to the 99.9+ quality available at present may be done by proprietary methods, of which the following may be considered representative.
Maintaining bromine at 50 °C for 4 h with provision for removal of the vapor lowers the chlorine content from 0.12 to 0.06 % and moisture from 0.05 to 0.005 %. Passing predried, vaporized bromine and oxygen through a tube packed with quartz or Vycor glass fragments and heating to 1000 °C decomposes organic halogen compounds, such as chloroform. Heating bromine vapor to 370 – 540 °C decomposes organic impurities to HCl and to higher boiling compounds which can be removed by distillation. A mixture of steam and bromine can be heated to similar temperatures. Upon cooling, the impurities remain largely in the aqueous phase. Absorption of bromine by a bromide solution with subsequent steam stripping provides highly purified bromine with essentially no chlorine.
To avoid corrosion of lead, nickel, or monel containers, less than 30 ppm water should be present in bromine. Drying with concentrated sulfuric acid removes most of the moisture. Organic impurities can be removed by distilling bromine at 58 °C with 96 % sulfuric acid, ca. 2 L/1000 kg, washing the condensed bromine with water, and drying countercurrently with 98 % acid. In addition drying can be done with molecular sieves, type 3 A – 5 A (0.3 – 0.5 nm). The laboratory preparation of extremely pure bromine for physical properties determination has been described.

- The input exchange 'chlorine, liquid, production mix' does not have an activity link and therefore requires a market for that input to be available. If the market is not available the dataset will be put on hold at the end of its review and will remain on hold until such a market has been accepted into the ecoinvent database.
