          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant. 
</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">This market represents the conveyance of 1 kg of "rare earth tailings, from bastnaesite and monazite ore" from the location where the tailings are generated to the facility where they are processed.
As the rare earth tailings are generated close to the facility where they are processed, transport is not included.</text>

          <comment xml:lang="en">Oxygen content in the tailings is calculated as the sum of oxygen contents of each individual compound present in the rare earth tailings. The oxygen content in each compound is calculated by multiplying the amount of chemical compound content in the tailings with the subtotal mass of oxygen in the compound using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: &lt;https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm&gt;). The oxygen content of each compound is provided on the properties comment field of the respective compound. For reasons explained in the comment section of the iron content, even though the iron content of FeO compound is not taken into account, the oxygen content is nevertheless considered. Feo content in the tailings is 2.38% and the subtotal mass of oxygen in that compound is 22.27%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.

The total content of Fe in the tailings is: 15.74%. Only the total Fe in the tailings is considered here, meaning that the content of FeO in the tailings that is reported in the abovementioned publication (as one part of the total iron content) has been omitted to avoid double counting. However the oxygen content of the FeO has been considered in the calculation of oxygen content. FeO content in the tailings is 2.38%. Subtotal masses of FeO are: Fe:77.74%, O:22.27% (see property comment of oxygen).

Study on recycling and leaching valuable elements from Bayan Obo tailings. Metall. Res. Technol., 116(1), 114. doi:10.1051/metal/2018040. The calculation of the individual contents of each compound in the tailings is based on the subtotal masses of the elements in each compound. The subtotal masses are calculated using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm). The content of ThO2 in the tailings is: 0.021%. The subtotal masses of ThO2 are: Th:87.88%, O:12.12%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.

          <comment xml:lang="en">The composition of the rare earth tailings is taken from Table 2 of the following publication: Zhang, B., Xue, X., Huang, X., Yang, H., &amp; Chen, G. (2019). Study on recycling and leaching valuable elements from Bayan Obo tailings. Metall. Res. Technol., 116(1), 114. doi:10.1051/metal/2018040. The calculation of the individual contents of each compound in the tailings is based on the subtotal masses of the elements in each compound. The subtotal masses are calculated using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm). The content of F in the tailings is: 3.14%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.

The subtotal masses are calculated using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm). The total content of Fe in the tailings is: 15.74%. Only the total Fe in the tailings is considered here, meaning that the content of FeO in the tailings that is reported in the abovementioned publication (as one part of the total iron content) has been omitted to avoid double counting. However the oxygen content of the FeO has been considered in the calculation of oxygen content. FeO content in the tailings is 2.38%. Subtotal masses of FeO are: Fe:77.74%, O:22.27% (see property comment of oxygen). In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.

          <comment xml:lang="en">Oxygen content in the tailings is calculated as the sum of oxygen contents of each individual compound present in the rare earth tailings. The oxygen content in each compound is calculated by multiplying the amount of chemical compound content in the tailings with the subtotal mass of oxygen in the compound using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: &lt;https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm&gt;). The oxygen content of each compound is provided on the properties comment field of the respective compound. For reasons explained in the comment section of the iron content, even though the iron content of FeO compound is not taken into account, the oxygen content is nevertheless considered. Feo content in the tailings is 2.38% and the subtotal mass of oxygen in that compound is 22.27%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported.
