          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">This dataset represents the supply of 1 unit of lorry (16 metric tons) from activities that produce it within the geography Europe (RER).
A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 0.6%-1.1% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 54.30-147.46 in the same period).

Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for road freight transport. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf "Annual road freight transport, by type of goods and type of transport (1 000 t, Mio Tkm), from 2008 onwards (road_go_ta_tg)" (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category "GT12 - Transport equipment" in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of road transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 250 km. The fraction of goods transported by road (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 88.5% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by road in 2016 was 221 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.</comment>

The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category "GT12 - Transport equipment" in the year 2016 for the European Union (current composition). The average distance of transport by inland waterways for goods in this category in 2016 was 472 km. The fraction of goods transported by inland waterways (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 0.4% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by inland waterways in 2016 was 2 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.</comment>
