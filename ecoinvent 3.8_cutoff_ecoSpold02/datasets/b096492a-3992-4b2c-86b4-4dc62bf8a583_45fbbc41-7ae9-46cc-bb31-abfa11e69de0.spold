          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.</text>

        <comment xml:lang="en">This is a conditional exchange, i.e. it is activated only during the linking of the consequential system model. During the linking of the allocation system model this market behaves as any other market.

The market for heat, municipal waste incineration is not fully elastic, which means that in a case when demand is higher than supply one of the uses of heat, municipal waste incineration will be affected by this shortage. 

In the linking of the consequential system model, this negative by-product will be moved to be a positive input linked to heat, district waste incineration, to generic market for heat district or industrial, other than natural gas linking activity, which is the activity that will reduce the consumption of the exchange in response to a demand. 

This means that an additional demand for heat, municipal waste incineration will be supplied by reducing the volume of the heat, district waste incineration, to generic market for heat district or industrial, other than natural gas linking activity thereby liberating the demanded amount of heat, municipal waste incineration.</comment>
