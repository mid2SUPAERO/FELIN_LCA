        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">phosphorus oxychloride'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 010025-87-3. It is called 'phosphoryl trichloride' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Cl3OP. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a pungent odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: semiconductors and chemicals, as a precursor for plasticisers and flame retardants.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">This is the market for  'phosphorus oxychloride', in the geography of Europe. 
</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of phosphorus oxychloride from activities that produce it within the geography RER.
The transport amounts are based on eurostat transport statistics for 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database, extracted on the 2018-06-01). See exchange comments for additional details.

          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.

The transport data was extracted from the database leaf 'Annual road freight transport, by type of goods and type of transport (1 000 t, Mio Tkm), from 2008 onwards (road_go_ta_tg)' (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category 'GT08 - Chemicals, chemical products, and man-made fibers; rubber and plastic products ; nuclear fuel' in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of road transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 216 km. The fraction of goods transported by road (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 79% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by road in 2016 was 171 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.</comment>
