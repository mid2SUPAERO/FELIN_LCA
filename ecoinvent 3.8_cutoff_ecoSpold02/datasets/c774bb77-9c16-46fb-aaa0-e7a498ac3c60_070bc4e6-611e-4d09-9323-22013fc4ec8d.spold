The dataset is a service dataset. It includes the energy demand (supplied by consumption of electricity and natural gas) for evaporating 1kg of water, when drying grain at low moisture content at low temperature (60°C) . The data for energy demand are based on the drying at farm, in column dryer, at low temperature of maize from 25% to 14% moisture content.  Also included in the inventory is the infrastructure (building and machinery) and land use. 
The dataset does not include waste and air emissions (like dust). Grain input, production of the wet educt and utilisation of the dried product are not included.</includedActivitiesEnd>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Drying at farm, in column dryer, at low temperature (60°C) of grains like maize. Fan motor power is 9.7 kW, and mixing is performed with 3 motors of 3.9 kW each. Evaporation capacity is 5.38 t/h of dried maize grain. 

Column dryer is a rather old technology, commonly used in 2000's. It is replaced by more efficient technologies like hot air silo dryer or air recirculation dryer (CRAAQ, 2010). After drying, grains are usually stored in a 350 tonnes capacity ventilated silo for about 10 days. 
Dust and particulate emission to air are not considered.  </text>

This value is therefore a rough estimation. It may underestimate the real price since there are additional expenses when producing any product. These expences can include for example labour costs, treatment of waste materials and profit for the producer.

        <comment xml:lang="en">This data has been copied from the "drying of bread, seed and legumes, GLO" dataset. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.

Estimation. A typical grain-drying plant consists of the dryer itself, built on a surface area of 150 square meters (about 12 m * 12 m), and up to four storeys in height (Häusermann 2002). Most plants do not have a storehouse. As with the drying plants for grass and maize, this surface is included as "building, hall", with a lifetime of 50 years as well. The total surface area of a plant, including building surface and surroundings, was also estimated to be 3000 square meters (Häusermann 2002). The total surface area of a plant was also included for the building and dismantling phases as "occupation, construction site". The area of the building, and of the land transformation, calculated for one kilogram evaporated water, is obtained by dividing the total surface area of the building or of the environs by the annual yield of dried product, the water evaporated per kilogram of dried product and by the lifetime of the infrastructure.

The capacity utilization rate is 4/12 (4 months per year)</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">This data has been copied from the "drying of bread, seed and legumes, GLO" dataset. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.

Estimation. An estimate of the total weight of the machines was made (40 tonnes for grain-drying plants) which was calculated as cast iron, the main component of this machinery (Kunz 2002, Walia 2002). The weight for the heater inventoried in this module (5 tonnes) was subtracted from the estimated weight of the machinery used in the drying process. The weight of the machinery, balanced as cast iron, per kilogram of water evaporated, was calculated in the same way as the area of the building and the land transformation. The expected useful life of the machinery was 25 years. Construction and Maintenance processes for the machinery were not included.

Estimation. A typical grain-drying plant consists of the dryer itself, built on a surface area of 150 square meters (about 12 m * 12 m), and up to four storeys in height (Häusermann 2002). Most plants do not have a storehouse. As with the drying plants for grass and maize, this surface is included as "building, hall", with a lifetime of 50 years as well. The total surface area of a plant, including building surface and surroundings, was also estimated to be 3000 square meters (Häusermann 2002). The total surface area of a plant was also included for the building and dismantling phases as "occupation, construction site". The area of the building, and of the land transformation, calculated for one kilogram evaporated water, is obtained by dividing the total surface area of the building or of the environs by the annual yield of dried product, the water evaporated per kilogram of dried product and by the lifetime of the infrastructure.</comment>

Estimation. It was assumed that there was a transformation from "pasture and meadow" occupancy to "industrial area" occupancy. The area of the building, and of the land transformation, calculated for one kilogram evaporated water, is obtained by dividing the total surface area of the building or of the environs by the annual yield of dried product, the water evaporated per kilogram of dried product and by the lifetime of the infrastructure.</comment>
