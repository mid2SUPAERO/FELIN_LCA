          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">The product 'sawlog and veneer log, meranti, debarked, measured as solid wood' represents tropical roundwood from the hardwood species meranti (Shorea ssp. , Lauan, Seraya). The amount is expressed as solid wood excluding bark. The wood is debarked at plantation site with a mobile debarker. </text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.</text>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Transport distances are calculated based on the transport distances to maritime harbour in Malaysia (taken from ecoinvent report no. 21, Figure 5.8) and default transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for road freight transport. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf 'Annual road freight transport, by type of goods and type of transport (1 000 t, Mio Tkm), from 2008 onwards (road_go_ta_tg)' (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category 'GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media' in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of road transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 203 km. The fraction of goods transported by road (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 91.8% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by road in 2016 was 187 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe. </comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Transport distances are calculated based on the transport distances to maritime harbour in Malaysia (taken from ecoinvent report no. 21, Figure 5.8) and default transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for road freight transport. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf 'Annual road freight transport, by type of goods and type of transport (1 000 t, Mio Tkm), from 2008 onwards (road_go_ta_tg)' (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category 'GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media' in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of road transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 203 km. The fraction of goods transported by road (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 91.8% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by road in 2016 was 187 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe. </comment>
