        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">BOARD PRODUCTION: The data for the production of SUB/SBB were collected from four European mills, together producing in excess of 90% of the total annual production of SSB/SUB in Europe in 2017 (which is estimated at approximately 1 100 000 tonnes net saleable product. The mills contributing with data are located in Finland and Sweden. The mills have a production volume of between 55 000 – 470 000 tonnes net saleable paper product . The data is collated by Pro Carton in their internal report "European Environmental Database for Cartonboard and Carton Production", which is not made publicly available.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="5">CARTON CONVERTING: The carton converting data were collected from 33 European factories together representing the production of over 380 000 tonnes cartons. hese convertors were located in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. They varied in size producing between 1 000 and 50 000 tonnes of finished cartons ready for shipment.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Data for the production of SBB/SUB and conversion of the board into cartons were provided by the European industry associations for cartonboard producers (Pro Carton) and convertors (ECMA European Carton Makers Association).</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This dataset is a copy of the respective European actvity. It is an aggregated process which includes the production of SSB or SUB, transport of the board to converting sites and converting of the board (printing, cutting, creasing) into blank boxes ready for delivery. SSB (also known as SBS and GZ) and SUB (also known as SUS) are packaging grades of board used to manufacture cartons. They are made using 100% virgin fibres. SBB is typically made from pure bleached chemical pulp with two or three layers of coating on the top surface and one or more layers on the reverse. There are also uncoated grades. Typical markets include cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, graphics, tobacco and luxury packaging. SUB is typically made from pure unbleached chemical pulp with two or three layers of coating on the top surface.  In some cases, a white reverse surface is applied.  It is primarily used as beverage carriers for bottles and cans, as it is very strong and can be made resistant to water.  It is used where strength of packaging is important. SUB may also be used in the production of liquid beverage cartons and liquid food cartons. The manufacture of these grades is in integrated mills, but some pulp is purchased.  The board is converted into a carton at a converting site which typically includes a printing process and cutting/creasing of the board into carton blanks, ready for delivery to and erection by the packer/filler.</text>

The transport data was extracted from the database leaf 'Annual road freight transport, by type of goods and type of transport [1 000 t, Mio Tkm], from 2008 onwards (road_go_ta_tg)' (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category "GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media" in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of road transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 203 km. The fraction of goods transported by road (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 91.8% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by road in 2016 was 187 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.")</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for transport of goods by inland waterways. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf "Transport by type of good (from 2007 onwards with NST2007) (iww_go_atygo)" (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category "GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media" in the year 2016 for the European Union (current composition). The average distance of transport by inland waterways for goods in this category in 2016 was 322 km. The fraction of goods transported by inland waterways (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 0.6% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by inland waterways in 2016 was 2 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for railway transport of goods. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf "Railway transport - goods transported, by group of goods - from 2008 onwards based on NST 2007 (1 000 t, million tkm) (rail_go_grpgood)" (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category "GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media" in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 328 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 7.7% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by rail in 2016 was 25 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Combined with the input of aluminium, primary, ingot, this is a proxy for aluminium printing plates for the litho printing process. A litho printing plate is a thin sheet of anodised fine grain hardened aluminium used in the printing industry. The photographically prepared (etched picture on to the aluminium) printing plate is treated chemically so the image will accept ink. This processing of the sheet usually occurs at the converting site, which will have its own prepress facility. The energy used in the prepress activity is captured in the energy data collected from the sites, but data on chemicals used etc., is not captured. However, it is anticipated that these will fall below the cur-off criteria defined in the data collection exercise. </comment>

        <samplingProcedure xml:lang="en">Data were collected from the producers by Pro Carton and ECMA for their European Environmental Database for Cartonboard and Carton Manufacturing and reviewed by the Institut für Energie- und Umweltforschung Heidelberg (ifeu). The data for the production of SBB/SUB were collected from mills, which together represent &gt;90% of the total yearly production of SBB/SUB in Europe. Annual production of SBB/SUB (excluding liquid packaging board) in Europe for 2017 was approximately 670 000 tonnes. Data were provided by mills in Finland and Sweden. Each mill produces between 55 000 - 470 000 tonnes of net saleable paper (including their liquid packaging board capacity). Carton converting data were provided by factories in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom representing over 380 000 tonnes of production of converted cartons, or about 5% of European converting operation by volumae. They varied in size producing between 1 000 and 50 000 tonnes of finished cartons ready for shipment. </samplingProcedure>
        <extrapolations xml:lang="en">Exchanges identical to GLO dataset. Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). 

Additional air emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels estimated based on industrial heating datasets from the ecoinvent database and matched as follows: light fuel oil: heat production, light fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland heavy fuel oil: heat production, heavy fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland hard coal: heat production, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW, Europe without Switzerland natural gas: heat production, natural gas, at industrial furnace &gt;100kW, Europe without Switzerland lignite briquettes and peat: heat production, lignite briquette, at stove 5-15kW, Europe without Switzerland wood chips: heat production, wood chips from industry, at furnace 1000kW, CH.
Black liquor is a byproduct of the SBB/SUB production process and used as internal fuel to generate process energy.  The black liquor recovery process differs largely from a simple combustion process. No emission profile for the recovery and or combustion of black liquor was available. The key emission factors reported by Pro Carton do include the emissions from the black liquor combustion of biogenic CO2. Other emissions from black liquor combustion were not included, due to the lack of an appropriate proxy.</extrapolations>

- An activity with a positive reference product can only have one material for treatment as an intermediate input (sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass). For the location CA-QC the exchanges sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass are considered materials for treatment because they are not being produced as reference products at CA-QC or within locations contained within. When determining the material for treatment state of an exchange for the location of the dataset only the current state of the database is taken into account. Other datasets submitted alongside the dataset currently being validated are not taken into account.

- An activity with a positive reference product can only have one material for treatment as an intermediate input (sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass). For the location CA-QC the exchanges sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass are considered materials for treatment because they are not being produced as reference products at CA-QC or within locations contained within. When determining the material for treatment state of an exchange for the location of the dataset only the current state of the database is taken into account. Other datasets submitted alongside the dataset currently being validated are not taken into account.

- An activity with a positive reference product can only have one material for treatment as an intermediate input (bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass | sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state). For the location CA-QC the exchanges bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass | sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state are considered materials for treatment because they are not being produced as reference products at CA-QC or within locations contained within. When determining the material for treatment state of an exchange for the location of the dataset only the current state of the database is taken into account. Other datasets submitted alongside the dataset currently being validated are not taken into account.
