          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">No transport or losses are considered in the modelling of this market, as producers and consumers are not physically separated.</text>

If electricity is taken from a market for electricity, the transmission infrastructure, country-specific losses and transformation losses (for markets for medium and low voltage) are included. Covers voltages between 1kV and 24 kV. Electricity that is produced internally in the incineration plant. Excess electricity is fed into 'market for electricity, medium voltage'.</text>

        <comment xml:lang="en">This is a conditional exchange, i.e. it is activated only during the linking of the consequential system model. During the linking of the allocation system model this market behaves as any other market.

The market for electricity, municipal waste incineration is not fully elastic, which means that in a case when demand is higher than supply one of the uses of electricity, municipal waste incineration will be affected by this shortage. 

In the linking of the consequential system model, this negative by-product will be moved to be a positive input linked to electricity, medium voltage, from waste incineration, to generic market for electricity, medium voltage linking activity, which is the activity that will reduce the consumption of the exchange in response to a demand. 

This means that an additional demand for electricity, municipal waste incineration will be supplied by reducing the volume of the electricity, medium voltage, from wasteincineration, to generic market for electricity, medium voltage linking activity thereby liberating the demanded amount of electricity, municipal waste incineration.</comment>
