          <comment xml:lang="en">The composition of the rare earth tailings is taken from Table 2 of the following publication: Zhang, B., Xue, X., Huang, X., Yang, H., &amp; Chen, G. (2019). Study on recycling and leaching valuable elements from Bayan Obo tailings. Metall. Res. Technol., 116(1), 114. doi:10.1051/metal/2018040. The calculation of the individual contents of each compound in the tailings is based on the subtotal masses of the elements in each compound. The subtotal masses are calculated using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm). The content of TiO2 in the tailings is: 1.08%. The subtotal masses of TiO2 are: Ti:59.93%, O:40.06%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.
