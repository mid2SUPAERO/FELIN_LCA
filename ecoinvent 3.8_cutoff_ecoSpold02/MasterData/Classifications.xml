Comment: This subclass includes:- educational services for programmes (ISCED Level 4) which, while happening after students finish Upper Secondary education, cannot be considered tertiary education because content-wise these programmes are not significantly more advanced than those from Upper Secondary. They are either short vocational programmes that lead students to the labour market or programmes with substantial theoretical background instruction specifically designed to prepare students for entry to tertiary education in cases where they had previously followed a curriculum (in Level 3 above) that lacked elements needed to entitle them to enter tertiary education programmes. Services in this subclass cover education which is not designed explicitly to prepare participants for a specific class of occupations or trades or for entry into further vocational or technical education programmes..</comment>

Comment: This subclass includes:- educational services for programmes (ISCED Level 4) which, while happening after students finish Upper Secondary education, cannot be considered tertiary education because content-wise these programmes are not significantly more advanced than those from Upper Secondary. They are either short vocational programmes that lead students to the labour market or programmes with substantial theoretical background instruction specifically designed to prepare students for entry to tertiary education in cases where they had previously followed a curriculum (in Level 3 above) that lacked elements needed to entitle them to enter tertiary education programmes. Services in this subclass cover education that prepares participants for direct entry, without further training, into specific occupations. Successful completion of such programmes leads to a labour-market relevant vocational qualification..</comment>

Comment: This section includes constructions and construction services. The former, in division 53, cover the physical outputs of construction activities (e.g., buildings or civil engineering works), while the latter, in division 54, cover the services provided in constructing these objects. A given unit produces just one of the two forms of output in a given production process (in division 53 if on own account, in division 54 if provided as a service). The valuation of the output will be different, according to the type of output produced.The categories in division 54 that relate to the construction of complete objects follow the same structure as categories in division 53. Division 54 also covers additional outputs that are only produced on a service basis (special trades)..</comment>

Comment: This group includes stimulants, spices and aromatic crops, as explained below.Stimulants are permanent trees or shrubs whose fruits or leaves are characterized by their alkaloid content, such as caffeine, theobromine and theine.Spices are plants which in one or the other of their components (rhizome, bark, fruits, berries, seeds, etc.), contain strongly flavoured and aromatic substances. For that reason they are used mainly as condiments, but have also applications for cosmetic and medicinal preparations. Most of these plants are perennial.Aromatic crops are leaves and seeds of numerous plants with less strong flavoured substances than spices but largely used in the kitchen. Most of these plants are spontaneous (not cultivated)..</comment>

      <comment xml:lang="en">Code: G Description: Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles Explanatory Note Inclusion: This section includes wholesale and retail sale (i.e. sale without transformation) of any type of goods and the rendering of services incidental to the sale of these goods. Wholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the distribution of goods. Goods bought and sold are also referred to as merchandise.

Also included in this section are the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles.

Sale without transformation is considered to include the usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, for example sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing (blending) of goods (for example sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packing, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled), cleaning and drying of agricultural products, cutting out of wood fibreboards or metal sheets as secondary activities.

Division 45 includes all activities related to the sale and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, while divisions 46 and 47 include all other sale activities. The distinction between division 46 (wholesale) and division 47 (retail sale) is based on the predominant type of customer.

Wholesale is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods to retailers, to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying goods for, or selling goods to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, i.e. wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are merchandise brokers, commission merchants and agents and assemblers, buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products. Wholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots, for example pharmaceuticals; store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design. 

Retailing is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods mainly to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilization, by shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers and peddlers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses etc. Most retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis.

The provision of general or routine maintenance (i.e. servicing) on such products to ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs is included. 

This division does only include specialized repair and maintenance activities. A substantial amount of repair is also done by manufacturers of machinery, equipment and other goods, in which case the classification of units engaged in these repair and manufacturing activities is done according to the value-added principle which would often assign these combined activities to the manufacture of the good. The same principle is applied for combined trade and repair. 

The rebuilding or remanufacturing of machinery and equipment is considered a manufacturing activity and included in other divisions of this section.

Repair and maintenance of goods that are utilized as capital goods as well as consumer goods is typically classified as repair and maintenance of household goods (e.g. office and household furniture repair, see 9524).

      <name xml:lang="en">C:Manufacturing</name>
      <comment xml:lang="en">Code: C Description: Manufacturing Explanatory Note Inclusion: This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.

Units engaged in manufacturing are often described as plants, factories or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, units that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public of products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries and custom tailors, are also included in this section. Manufacturing units may process materials or may contract with other units to process their materials for them. Both types of units are included in manufacturing.

The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.

Manufacture of specialized components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialized components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialized components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in class 2220.

Assembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. 

The recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in class 3830 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.

Specialized maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles). 

The installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialized activity, is classified in 3320. 

Remark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in ISIC:
- milk pasteurizing and bottling (see 1050)
- fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 1020)
- printing and related activities (see 1811, 1812)
- ready-mixed concrete production (see 2395)
- leather converting (see 1511)
- wood preserving (see 1610)
- electroplating, plating, metal heat treating, and polishing (see 2592)
- rebuilding or remanufacturing of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 2910)
- tyre retreading (see 2211)

Conversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of ISIC; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include:
- logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);
- beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); 
- beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying); 
- construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section F (Construction);
- activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging or bottling of products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing of paints to customers' order; and cutting of metals to customers' order, producing a modified version of the same product, are classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).

      <comment xml:lang="en">Code: B Description: Mining and quarrying Explanatory Note Inclusion: This section includes the extraction of minerals occurring naturally as solids (coal and ores), liquids (petroleum) or gases (natural gas). Extraction can be achieved by different methods such as underground or surface mining, well operation, seabed mining etc.
This section also includes supplementary activities aimed at preparing the crude materials for marketing, for example, crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating ores, liquefaction of natural gas and agglomeration of solid fuels. These operations are often carried out by the units that extracted the resource and/or others located nearby.
Mining activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of the principal mineral produced. Divisions 05, 06 are concerned with mining and quarrying of fossil fuels (coal, lignite, petroleum, gas); divisions 07, 08 concern metal ores, various minerals and quarry products. 
Some of the technical operations of this section, particularly related to the extraction of hydrocarbons, may also be carried out for third parties by specialized units as an industrial service, which is reflected in division 09. 

This section excludes the processing of the extracted materials (see section C - Manufacturing), which also covers the bottling of natural spring and mineral waters at springs and wells (see class 1104) or the crushing, grinding or otherwise treating certain earths, rocks and minerals not carried out in conjunction with mining and quarrying (see class 2399). This section also excludes the usage of the extracted materials without a further transformation for construction purposes (see section F - Construction), the collection, purification and distribution of water (see class 3600), separate site preparation activities for mining (see class 4312) and geophysical, geologic and seismic surveying activities (see class 7110).

      <comment xml:lang="en">Code: 10 Description: Manufacture of food products Explanatory Note Inclusion: This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products. The activity often generates associated products of greater or lesser value (for example, hides from slaughtering, or oilcake from oil production).
This division is organized by activities dealing with different kinds of products: meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, fats and oils, milk products, grain mill products, animal feeds and other food products. Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering.
Some activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers' own shop. However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to Wholesale and retail trade (section G).

Production of animal feeds from slaughter waste or by-products is classified in 1080, while processing food and beverage waste into secondary raw material is classified to 3830, and disposal of food and beverage waste in 3821. Explanatory Note Exclusion: [Empty]</comment>

      <comment xml:lang="en">Code: 18 Description: Printing and reproduction of recorded media Explanatory Note Inclusion: This division includes printing of products, such as newspapers, books, periodicals, business forms, greeting cards, and other materials, and associated support activities, such as bookbinding, plate-making services, and data imaging. The support activities included here are an integral part of the printing industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of the printing industry is almost always provided by these operations.
Processes used in printing include a variety of methods for transferring an image from a plate, screen, or computer file to a medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood. The most prominent of these methods entails the transfer of the image from a plate or screen to the medium through lithographic, gravure, screen or flexographic printing. Often a computer file is used to directly ''drive'' the printing mechanism to create the image or electrostatic and other types of equipment (digital or non-impact printing).
Though printing and publishing can be carried out by the same unit (a newspaper, for example), it is less and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same physical location.

This division also includes the reproduction of recorded media, such as compact discs, video recordings, software on discs or tapes, records etc.

This division excludes publishing activities (see section J). Explanatory Note Exclusion: [Empty]</comment>

Retail trade is classified first by type of sale outlet (retail trade in stores: groups 471 to 477; retail trade not in stores: groups 478 and 479). Retail trade in stores includes the retail sale of used goods (class 4774). For retail sale in stores, there exists a further distinction between specialized retail sale (groups 472 to 477) and non-specialized retail sale (group 471). The above groups are further subdivided by the range of products sold. Sale not via stores is subdivided according to the forms of trade, such as retail sale via stalls and markets (group 478) and other non-store retail sale, e.g. mail order, door-to-door, by vending machines etc. (group 479).

The goods sold in this division are limited to goods usually referred to as consumer goods or retail goods. Therefore goods not usually entering the retail trade, such as cereal grains, ores, industrial machinery etc., are excluded. This division also includes units engaged primarily in selling to the general public, from displayed goods, products such as personal computers, stationery, paint or timber, although these sales may not be for personal or household use. Some processing of goods may be involved, but only incidental to selling, e.g. sorting or repackaging of goods, installation of a domestic appliance etc.

      <comment xml:lang="en">Code: 31 Description: Manufacture of furniture Explanatory Note Inclusion: This division includes the manufacture of furniture and related products of any material except stone, concrete and ceramic. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture are standard methods of forming materials and assembling components, including cutting, moulding and laminating. The design of the article, for both aesthetic and functional qualities, is an important aspect of the production process.

Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in division 16 (Manufacture of wood and wood products). However, the multiple processes distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing. Similarly, metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacturing of roll-formed products classified in division 25 (Manufacture of fabricated metal products). The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products. However, the manufacture of plastics furniture tends to be a specialized activity.

This division also includes service activities incidental to agriculture, as well as hunting, trapping and related activities.

Group 015 (Mixed farming) breaks with the usual principles for identifying main activity. It accepts that many agricultural holdings have reasonably balanced crop and animal production and that it would be arbitrary to classify them in one category or the other.

Agricultural activities exclude any subsequent processing of the agricultural products (classified under divisions 10 and 11 (Manufacture of food products and beverages) and division 12 (Manufacture of tobacco products)), beyond that needed to prepare them for the primary markets. However, the preparation of products for the primary markets is included here.

The division excludes field construction (e.g. agricultural land terracing, drainage, preparing rice paddies etc.) classified in section F (Construction) and buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products classified in section G.

This means that activities classified elsewhere in ISIC do not fall under this section, even if carried out by public entities. For example, administration of the school system (i.e. regulations, checks, curricula) falls under this section, but teaching itself does not (see section P), and a prison or military hospital is classified to health (see section Q).

The manufacture of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes. More than one activity is often carried out in a single unit. There are essentially three activities: The manufacture of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper. The manufacture of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet. Converted paper products are made from paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques, including coating and laminating activities. The paper articles may be printed (e.g. wallpaper, gift wrap etc.), as long as the printing of information is not the main purpose.
